Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Overview 


Pewlett-Hackard needs to prepare for the large amount of employees that are retiring over the next few years. The company has thousands of employees and has asked for help in identifying these employees. The company needs to know the titles these employees hold and their salaries so they have an idea of which positions will need to be replaced and the amount of money they will need to anticipate spending on salaries as well.

The information was obtained from six original CSV files containing employee data. The analysis was performed using SQL to create relational databases between the original CSV files. This resulted in the creation of several more CSV files that were used to complete the final analysis required.

Results:
